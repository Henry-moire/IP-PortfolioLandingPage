        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Henry Moire. I have had a passion for computers since I was young and 
            spent most of my time playing games on the family desktop. As I grew older and 
            my love of computers only grew, I decided to do dedicate my career to computers 
            and their improvement as a computer Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>The journey towards being a chartered computer engineer started in high school with 
            the subject Computer Studies which served as the foundation of my computer science 
            knowledge. I spent the first year after high school doing a Foundation Year course 
            to teach me the basics of engineering. Finally, I joined Moringa School to do a course
            in Software Development ahead of university to ensure I have a strong foundation in coding.
