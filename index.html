    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Henry Moire. I have had a passion for computers since I was young and 
        spent most of my time playing games on the family desktop. As I grew older and 
        my love of computers only grew, I decided to do dedicate my career to computers 
        and their improvement as a computer Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>The journey towards being a chartered computer engineer started in high school with 
        the subject Computer Studies which served as the foundation of my computer science 
        knowledge. I spent the first year after high school doing a Foundation Year course 
        to teach me the basics of engineering. Finally, I joined Moringa School to do a course
        in Software Development ahead of university to ensure I have a strong foundation in coding.
